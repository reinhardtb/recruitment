SLIDE 1 (Title - centered):
Legacy Modernization: Extracting Loyalty Platform
Event-Driven Architecture in Regulated Environment
Presented by: [Your Name]
Context: iGaming Fintech

SLIDE 2 (Problem):
Title: The Business Challenge
Situation:
- Legacy monolithic systems handling core transactions
- Loyalty processing tightly coupled with gaming logic
- Slow user experience (3-5 second delays)
- Expensive to scale, difficult to evolve

Constraints:
- Cannot refactor legacy (business risk, regulatory compliance)
- Must maintain transactional integrity
- Gaming regulations require full audit trail
- Multi-datacenter deployments

SLIDE 3 (Architecture Options):
Title: Solution Alternatives Considered

Option 1: Big Bang Rewrite
✅ Clean slate, modern stack
❌ High risk, business disruption, regulatory re-certification
❌ 12-18 month timeline

Option 2: Database Replication
✅ Low initial effort
❌ Tight coupling remains, data consistency issues
❌ Doesn't solve scaling problem

Option 3: Event-Driven Extraction (Strangler Fig)
✅ Incremental migration, low risk
✅ Decouples loyalty from core systems
❌ Complexity: managing hybrid architecture
✅ Selected approach

SLIDE 4 (Solution Architecture):
Title: Event-Driven Extraction Pattern

High-Level Architecture:
Legacy Systems → Event Bridge → Cloud Platform → Modern Services

Key Decisions:
1. Hybrid Cloud: Keep legacy on-prem, new services in cloud
2. Event Sourcing: Transactional outbox for guaranteed delivery
3. Managed Services: Reduce operational burden
4. Compliance-First: Audit trail, encryption, data residency

SLIDE 5 (Critical Trade-offs):
Title: Key Architectural Trade-offs

Build vs. Buy Streaming Platform:
Decision: Managed Kafka (Confluent Cloud)
✅ 99.99% SLA, auto-scaling, reduced ops
❌ Vendor dependency, ongoing cost
Alternative: Self-managed Kafka (higher ops burden, lower SLA)

Language Choice:
Decision: Java for stream processing (team was .NET)
✅ Best-in-class streaming libraries, community support
❌ Team upskilling required (2 months)
Alternative: .NET with custom state management (6+ months dev time)

Data Retention:
Decision: 7-day hot storage (Kafka), long-term cold storage (warehouse)
✅ Cost-optimized, meets compliance
❌ Complexity of dual-storage strategy

SLIDE 6 (Organizational Impact):
Title: Communicating Architecture Decisions

To Executive Leadership:
- "Strangler fig reduces risk—incremental migration with rollback capability"
- "Managed services reduce ops overhead by 60%"
- "Faster loyalty updates improve player retention"

To Engineering Teams:
- "Learn industry-standard patterns used at scale (Netflix, Uber)"
- "Exactly-once processing—no manual reconciliation"
- "Event-driven enables future features with minimal cost"

To Compliance/Legal:
- "Immutable audit log for regulatory requirements"
- "Data residency controls (EU data stays in EU)"
- "Cryptographic guarantees for dispute resolution"

SLIDE 7 (Security & Compliance):
Title: Compliance Architecture

Gaming Regulations:
- 7+ year data retention (immutable storage)
- Complete audit trail for disputes
- Regional data residency

Financial Compliance:
- PCI-DSS: No payment data in loyalty system
- GDPR: Data minimization, right to erasure
- Encryption: At-rest and in-transit

Architecture Approach:
- Event log = single source of truth
- Separation of concerns (payment vs. loyalty)
- Automated compliance reporting

SLIDE 8 (Results & Impact):
Title: Business Outcomes

Performance:
- 70% reduction in latency (3-5s → <1s)
- Improved user experience, reduced support tickets

Scalability:
- Handles traffic spikes without manual intervention
- Cloud auto-scaling during peak periods

Risk Reduction:
- Legacy systems unchanged (no regulatory re-certification)
- Incremental rollout with rollback capability

Operational Efficiency:
- Reduced manual operations (managed services)
- Faster feature development (decoupled architecture)

SLIDE 9 (Lessons Learned):
Title: Architectural Insights

What Worked:
✅ Incremental migration (strangler fig) reduced risk significantly
✅ Investing in team skills (upskilling) paid off
✅ Managed services > DIY for non-differentiating infrastructure
✅ Event-driven architecture enables future innovation

What to Improve:
⚠️ Observability should be day-one, not added later
⚠️ Schema governance critical from start (avoid breaking changes)
⚠️ Cross-team communication overhead in hybrid architecture

Key Principle:
Architecture isn't about technology—it's about managing trade-offs to achieve business outcomes within constraints.

SLIDE 10 (Applicability):
Title: Relevant Patterns for Booking.com

Similar Challenges:
- Loyalty programs at scale (millions of users)
- Legacy system modernization (incremental, low-risk)
- Multi-region compliance (GDPR, data residency)
- Real-time processing (pricing, fraud detection)

Transferable Principles:
- Event-driven decoupling for evolution
- Strangler fig for legacy modernization
- Compliance-as-architecture
- Build vs. buy trade-offs
- Organizational change management

SLIDE 11 (Closing - centered):
"Architecture is about achieving business outcomes within constraints—technical, organizational, and regulatory."

"This project demonstrated: incremental migration, managing trade-offs, and aligning technical decisions with business value."
